Our remarketing service is provided by Google and other companies that show our ads on websites across the Internet. With remarketing you may see ads for our products you have previously looked at. As an example, suppose you visit a website that sells computers, but you do not buy a computer on your first visit to that website. The website&rsquo;s owner might like to encourage you to revisit his/her site and buy a computer by showing you his/her ads again on other websites that you visit. We use remarketing for similar purposes, so you may see advertisements for our products as you search the Internet. For this to happen Google or other remarketing providers will read a cookie that is already in your browser, or they place a cookie in your browser. <br></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">You can opt out of Google&rsquo;s use of cookies and remarketing at this link: &nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c1"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl%3Den&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1514058012188000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEbTyktHleQu14CF5brIqMkNGp8JA">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en</a></span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">or you opt out using the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page at: </span><span class="c3 c1"><a class="c11" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://optout.networkadvertising.org/%23!/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1514058012189000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjVJ8sT3FyDYGtHQoTdZ39RBplKQ">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/</a></span></p><p class="c6 c19"><span class="c3 c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c20 c7 c39">Facebook Remarketing</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Our mobile app uses Facebook remarketing advertising service.
